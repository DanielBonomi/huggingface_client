# huggingface_client
[![Build Status](https://github.com/shamblett/huggingface_client/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shamblett/huggingface_client/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A server and browser based [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) REST API client for the inference and inference endpoint APIs.

The client supports standard query based inference and inference tasks for Natural Language Processing(NLP),
Audio and Video. It also supports the inference endpoint API for creation and control of inference endpoints.

The bindings for the inference endpoint API are generated from the [Hugging Face Inference Endpoint OpenApi specification](lib/src/openapi/spec/openapi.json)
using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.

API documentation generated by the OpenAPI Generator can be found [here](lib/src/openapi/doc).

There is no such Open API specification for the inference API.

See the [examples.md](example/example.md) document in the examples folder for usage examples.

A Hugging Face API key is needed for authentication, see [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/quicktour) for
instructions on how to obtain this.

# Road Map

Client functionality will be added across several version releases, see below :-

Version 1.0.0(this one) contains inference query and NLP inference task queries.

Version 1.1.0 will add Audio and Video inference task queries.

Version 1.2.0 will add the inference endpoint API.
